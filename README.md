Hello, I am Jason Daou,
This is my solution to the coding challenge. To run my code, simply call python3 on Solution.py which is located in the venv folder. If you were to try my code with a diffrent data.csv file, please ensure that it is in the same folder as Solution.py and please note that my solution assumes there is a column called purpose and one called int_rate as is the case in the data.csv file provided.
